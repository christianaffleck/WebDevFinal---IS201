                                <ol>
                                    I was born in May of 2001 in SLC, Utah. I am the son of an American dad and a Norwegian mom, giving me wings to fly like an eagle and the strength to concquer, like a viking, the dreams I reach for. <br><br>
                                    Ever since I was a kid I loved to sing and create. Music has always been a part of my life and especially as a vocalist, I loved every ounce of it. I'm a performer. I love being up on the stage just having a good time.
                                    As I have grown, I've been able to have some amazing experiences and opportunities that have taken me places I never thought I'd be. With a children's choir I competed in the National known talent show, "America's Got Talent", 
                                    perfomed and collaborated with dozens of artists from around the world, sang for President Obama and his wife, in the White House, and more. I have written and co-written many songs. I was an All-American clogger two years in a row.
                                    As far as a musician and performer goes, I have been blessed to do a lot and am continuing to do so. <br><br>
                                    While I has living in Norway for two years, as a volenteer for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I began exploring photography and video production as well. I loved it! I have since been involved in many projects, both with the church and not.<br><br>
                                    Working now for BYU Music Group I get to expound my passions for content creation and video and audio production, as I work to market and produce large performing groups such as BYU Vocal Point, BYU Noteworthy, BYU Men's Chorus, and more. This is giving me great 
                                    experience as I get to be involved in proffessional work viewed by millions of people around the globe. I am sharpening skills in both the entertainment and business worlds that will hopefully continue to propell me forward. I am eager to grow and help those around me! I look forward to the future and what it holds. Here's to creating a better world!<br><br>
